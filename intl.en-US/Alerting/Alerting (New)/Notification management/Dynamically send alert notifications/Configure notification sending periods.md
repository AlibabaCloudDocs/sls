# Configure notification sending periods

The sending periods of alert notifications are determined by the Period parameter that is specified for action groups. You can customize a notification sending period by specifying the Period parameter.

If alerts are generated in a specified period, the alert notifications are sent. Otherwise, alert notifications are not sent.

**Note:** You can configure notification sending periods based on the settings of the global default calendar. The available sending periods include business days, non-business days, business hours, and non-business hours. For more information, see [Modify the global default calendar](/intl.en-US/Alerting/Alerting (New)/User management/Modify the global default calendar.md)
