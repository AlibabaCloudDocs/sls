# Overview

You can manage incident phases and perform operations on an alert incident to handle an alert. If an alert in a merge set is sent to the alert monitoring system and processed based on a specified alert policy, an alert incident is automatically created. You can set incident statuses and incident handlers in the console.

The following topics describe the relevant operations:
