# Overview

Alerts are triggered in the alert monitoring system. The alert monitoring system consists of alert monitoring rules and resource data. An alert monitoring rule is used to periodically monitor and evaluate query results. If an alert is triggered or cleared, the related alert notification or recovery notification is sent to the alert management system based on the monitoring rule orchestration.

You can perform the following operations in the alert monitoring system:
