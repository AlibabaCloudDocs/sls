# Overview

A dashboard in Log Service is a platform where you can analyze data in real time. You can add multiple charts to a dashboard for data analysis. Each chart visualizes the query result of a query statement.

When you open or refresh the dashboard in the Log Service console, the query statements of the charts on the dashboard are automatically executed.

In addition, Log Service allows you to embed console pages into your website and share the pages. This way, you can analyze and display data in a flexible manner. For more information, see [Embed console pages and share log data](/intl.en-US/Developer Guide/Other visualization methods/Embed console pages and share log data.md). When you add a chart to a dashboard, you can [configure drill-down analysis](/intl.en-US/Visualization/Dashboard/Configure a drill-down event for a chart.md) for the chart. Then you can obtain more fine-grained analysis results.
