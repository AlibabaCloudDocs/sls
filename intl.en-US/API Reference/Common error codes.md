# Common error codes {#reference_ypb_rtq_12b .reference}

When an API request error occurs, Log Service returns an error message, including the HTTP status code and the specific error details in the response body. The error details in the response body are in the following formats:

``` {#codeblock_nml_17a_ciw}
{
"errorCode" : <ErrorCode>,
"errorMessage" : <ErrorMessage>
}
```

Among all the error messages that may be returned by Log Service, some are applicable to most of the APIs, while the others are unique to some APIs. See the following common error codes in the response of multiple APIs. For the error codes unique to some APIs, see the descriptions in the corresponding API reference.
