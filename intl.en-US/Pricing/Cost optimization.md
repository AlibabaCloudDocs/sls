# Cost optimization {#concept_ih5_fvn_vdb .concept}

Cost is related to two factors:

-   Data volume. Data volume is determined by your business needs and cannot be optimized.The amount of user data is determined by the business and cannot be optimized.
-   •Configurations. Configurations can be optimized. With the configurations matching with the amount of data, you can select the optimal solution to minimize the cost.

## Optimizing configurations {#section_mh5_hvn_vdb .section}

Configurations can be optimized in the following two aspects:

-   Number of shards

    The price for one shard is USD 0.04 per day, with a maximum data processing capability of 5 MB/s.  Only shards in readwrite status are charged.  Adjust the number of shards so that each shard can process data exactly at 5 MB/s.  To reduce the number of shards, merge the shards. 

-   Storage cycle of indexes

    We recommend that you optimize the storage time of indexes based on your requirements for log query and storage.

    -   If you collect the logs for stream computing, we recommend that you only use LogHub, without creating indexes.

    -   If you want to store and back up logs for a long time, we recommend that you configure the Object Storage Service \(OSS\) Shipper, and import the logs to OSS.


## Other optimization recommendations {#section_mkt_3vn_vdb .section}

-   Use Logtail: With the functions of batch processing and breakpoint transmission, data is transmitted with optimal algorithm while guaranteeing the real-timeliness. Logtail consumes 3/4 less resources than that of the open-source software \(such as Logstash and Fluentd\), thus reducing CPU consumption.
-   Try to use large packages \(64 KB–1 MB\) to write logs by using API, thus reducing the number of requests.
-   Only index key fields \(for example, UserID and Action\), without configuring indexes for useless fields.
