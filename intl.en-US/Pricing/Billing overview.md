## Billing methods

-   Pay-as-you-go

    Log Service supports the pay-as-you-go billing method. When you use the pay-as-you-go billing method, you are charged based on the amount of resources that you have consumed. Log Service also offers free quotas on a monthly basis. For more information, see [Pay-as-you-go](/intl.en-US/Pricing/Pay-as-you-go.md).

-   Subscription resource plans

    You can purchase a subscription resource plan. For example, you can purchase subscription resource plans for read/write traffic, indexing traffic, or occupied storage space. The resources that you use are deducted from the relevant resource plan. For more information, see [t125824.md\#]().


## Billing items and methods

**Note:** You can use Log Service to collect log data and time series data. The price of time series data and indexing is different from the price of log data. The price of other billing items such as data transformation, data shipping, read/write traffic, and read/write requests are the same as the price of log data.

|Billing items and methods|Description|
|-------------------------|-----------|
|Read/write traffic|Read/write traffic is calculated based on the compressed log data. The compression ratio is 10% to 20%. Read/write traffic includes the traffic that is generated by data consumption in streaming mode. Example: A total of 10 GB of raw logs are generated. After the logs are written to Log Service, they are compressed to 1.5 GB. In this case, 1.5 GB of log data incur fees.**Note:**

-   The consumption preview feature in the Log Service console also generates a small amount of streaming consumption traffic.
-   Traffic generated by index-based queries and analysis is free of charge. For example, you are not charged when you query and analyze logs, generate reports, or use the alert feature in the Log Service console. |
|Storage space occupied by log data|The storage space is the total size of compressed log data and the indexes. Example: Log data is written to Log Service at a speed of 1 GB per day and is compressed to 200 MB. Indexing is enabled for 10% of the raw log data. The size of indexes is 100 MB. If the data is stored for 30 days, the maximum cumulative storage space after 30 days is 9 GB \(30 days × 100 MB/day + 30 days × 200 MB/day = 9 GB\).|
|Storage space occupied by time series data|The storage space that time series data occupies is measured based on the size of the raw data.|
|Indexes created or recreated for log data|You are charged for the indexing traffic only once. This traffic is calculated based on the indexed fields. Example: If the fields to be queried account for 10% of logs whose size is 10 GB, an indexing fee is billed for 1 GB of log data.**Note:**

-   By default, the indexing feature is disabled. Indexing traffic incurs fees after you enable and use the indexing feature.
-   Indexing traffic is calculated only once if you create both full text indexes and key/value indexes.
-   Created indexes occupy storage space. Therefore, storage space fees are incurred. |
|Indexes created for time series data|
|Active shards|Only shards in the readwrite state incur fees. Merged or split shards do not incur fees. Example: You need to merge three shards in the readwrite state. After you merge them, one shard is in the readwrite state, and the other two shards become read-only. On the day that you merge these three shards, you are charged for three shards. On the next day, you are charged for only one shard.You can write 430 GB of log data per day to a shard. |
|Read/write operations|The number of operations that write logs to Log Service depends on the speed at which logs are generated. Log Service can minimize the number of read/write operations at the backend.|
|Read traffic over the Internet|When log data collected by Log Service is read and consumed by applications outside Alibaba Cloud internal network, you are charged for the generated data traffic.|
|Data transformation|You are charged for the server and network resources consumed when you use the data transformation feature.**Note:** If data is transmitted across regions for data transformation, Internet traffic is generated and compressed. You are charged for the compressed Internet traffic. |
|LogShipper|You are charged for data that is shipped to OSS, MaxCompute, AnalyticDB for MySQL, and TSDB.|

## Free quotas

Log Service provides free quotas for some billing items. The following table shows the item details.

**Note:** Log Service offers free quotas on a monthly basis and clears them at the end of each month. If the amount of resources used in a month is within the free quotas, you are not charged. Otherwise, you are charged for the excess amount.

|Billing items and methods|Free monthly quota|
|:------------------------|:-----------------|
|Storage space occupied by log data|500 MB|
|Read/write traffic|500 MB|
|Indexes created or recreated for log data|500 MB|
|Active shards|31 \(one shard per day\)|
