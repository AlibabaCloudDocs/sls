## Billing methods

-   Pay-as-you-go

    Log Service supports the pay-as-you-go billing method. When you use the pay-as-you-go billing method, you are charged based on the amount of consumed resources. Log Service also offers monthly free quotas. For more information, see [Pay-as-you-go](/intl.en-US/Pricing/Pay-as-you-go.md).


## Billable items

**Note:** You can use Log Service to collect log data and time series data. The pricing of storage and indexes for time series data is different from the pricing of storage and indexes for log data. However, the pricing of other billable items for time series data is the same as the pricing of other billable items for log data. The billable items include data transformation, data shipping, read and write traffic, and number of requests.

|Billable item|Description|
|-------------|-----------|
|Read and write traffic|Read and write traffic is calculated based on the compressed log data. The compression ratio is 10:1 to 5:1. Read and write traffic includes the traffic that is generated by data consumption in streaming mode. For example, assume that 10 GB of raw logs are generated. After the logs are written to Log Service, these logs are compressed to 1.5 GB. In this case, you are charged for 1.5 GB of log data.**Note:**

-   The consumption preview feature in the Log Service console can also be used to generate a small amount of streaming consumption traffic.
-   Traffic generated by index-based queries and analysis is free of charge. For example, you are not charged when you query and analyze logs, generate reports, or use the alert feature in the Log Service console. |
|Storage space occupied by log data|The storage space is the total size of compressed log data and indexes. For example, assume that log data is written to Log Service at a speed of 1 GB per day and is compressed to 200 MB. Indexes are created for 10% of the raw log data. The size of indexes is 100 MB. If the data is stored for 30 days, the maximum cumulative storage space after 30 days is 9 GB \(30 days × 100 MB/day + 30 days × 200 MB/day = 9 GB\).|
|Storage space occupied by time series data|The storage space that time series data occupies is measured based on the size of the raw data.|
|Indexes created or recreated for log data|You are charged for the index traffic only once. This traffic is calculated based on the indexed fields. For example, if you create indexes for 10% of fields in 10 GB of logs, you are charged for 1 GB of index traffic.**Note:**

-   By default, the indexing feature is disabled. Index traffic incurs fees after you enable and use the indexing feature.
-   Index traffic is calculated only once if you create both full text indexes and key/value indexes.
-   Created indexes occupy storage space. Therefore, storage space fees are incurred. |
|Indexes created for time series data|
|Active shards|Only shards in the readwrite state incur fees. Merged or split shards do not incur fees. For example, assume that you need to merge three shards in the readwrite state. After you merge these shards, one shard is in the readwrite state, and the other two shards become read-only. On the day that you merge these three shards, you are charged for three shards. On the next day, you are charged for only one shard.You can write 430 GB of log data per day to a shard. |
|Read and write operations|The number of operations that write logs to Log Service depends on the speed at which logs are generated. Log Service can minimize the number of read and write operations at the backend.|
|Read traffic over the Internet|When log data collected by Log Service is read and consumed by applications outside the Alibaba Cloud internal network, you are charged for the generated data traffic.|
|Data transformation|You are charged for the server and network resources that are consumed when you use the data transformation feature.**Note:** If data is transmitted across regions for data transformation, Internet traffic is generated and compressed. You are charged for the compressed Internet traffic. |
|Data shipping|You are charged for data that is shipped to OSS, MaxCompute, AnalyticDB for MySQL, and TSDB. The fees are calculated based on the size of the raw data.|
