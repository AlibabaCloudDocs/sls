# Why am I charged after I only create projects and Logstores?

Log Service allows you to read data from and write data to shards. When you create a Logstore, Log Service allocates shard resources to the Logstore. Therefore, you may be charged for active shards. For more information about the fees incurred by active shards, see [Why am I charged for active shards?](/intl.en-US/Pricing/FAQ/Why am I charged for active shards?.md).

If you no longer need to use a Logstore, delete the Logstore at your earliest opportunity to prevent additional fees.

**Warning:** After you delete a Logstore, all log data in the Logstore is deleted and cannot be restored. Proceed with caution.
