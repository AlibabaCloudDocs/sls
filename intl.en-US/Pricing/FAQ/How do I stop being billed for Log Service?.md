# How do I stop being billed for Log Service?

After Log Service is activated, you cannot deactivate it. If you no longer need to use Log Service, you only need to delete projects. You are still charged for data storage on the day that you delete the projects. However, you are not charged on the next day. Bills are no longer generated for Log Service two days after you delete the projects.

## Procedure

**Warning:** After you delete your projects, all related log data and resource configurations are deleted and cannot be restored. Proceed with caution.

1.  Log on to the [Log Service console](https://sls.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the Projects section, click **Delete** in the Actions column of the project that you want to delete.

3.  In the Delete Project panel, enter the project name and select a reason.

4.  Click **OK**.
