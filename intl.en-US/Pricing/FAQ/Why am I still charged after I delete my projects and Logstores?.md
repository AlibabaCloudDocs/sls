# Why am I still charged after I delete my projects and Logstores?

After you delete your projects and Logstores, you are stilled charged on the day you delete them. You receive the bill the next day. After you receive the bill, we recommend that you check whether the generated bill is for the day on which you delete your projects and Logstores. For more information about billing details, see [View billing details](/intl.en-US/Pricing/View billing details.md).

**Note:** Fees are deducted from the balance of your Alibaba Cloud account on a daily basis. A bill is generated every day based on the amount of resources that you consume on the previous day.
