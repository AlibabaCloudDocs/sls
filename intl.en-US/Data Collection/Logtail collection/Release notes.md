# Release notes

This topic describes the release notes of Log Service Logtail.

## 0.16.60

-   New features

    Container data in the containerd environment can be collected.


## 0.16.56

-   Optimized features

    The coverage of the net\_err\_stat metric is adjusted to cover only sending errors caused by network issues.


## 0.16.54

-   New features

    The net\_err\_stat metric is added in service logs. The number of sending errors that occur in the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes can be recorded.


## 0.16.52

If a large number of Logtail configuration files are created to collect container data \(standard outputs or container files\), we recommend that you upgrade Logtail to V0.16.52 or later. This allows you to reduce the CPU overhead.

-   Optimized features

    The CPU overhead during container data collection is optimized.


## 0.16.50

-   New features

    The Telegraf plug-in can be installed as needed at runtime. This feature is applicable only to users who use Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\) over the internal network of Alibaba Cloud.


## 0.16.48

-   Optimized features

    The service\_telegraf plug-in is optimized. Multiple configuration files are supported on a single machine.


## 0.16.46

**Note:** If the endpoint of Log Service is in the China \(Hangzhou\), China \(Shanghai\), or China \(Beijing\) region, you can upgrade Logtail to V0.16.46 or later. This prevents Logtail from switching endpoints when network jitter occurs.

-   Optimized features

    The network types that can be used in Logtail are strictly limited.


## 0.16.44

-   New features

    The service\_telegraf plug-in is added to collect metric data.


## 0.16.42

-   New features

    Multi-level matching is supported when you use a blacklist to filter data. Example: /path/\*\*/log.

-   Optimized features

    The policy used to obtain local IP addresses is optimized. If a policy is invalid, the first IP address in the IP address list is obtained.


## 0.16.40

-   New features
    -   The metric\_system\_v2 plug-in is added to collect the data of host statuses.
    -   The max\_docker\_config\_update\_times parameter is added in the ALIYUN\_LOGTAIL\_MAX\_DOCKER\_CONFIG\_UPDATE\_TIMES environment variable. The added parameter is applicable to scenarios where you need to frequently create short-lived jobs in a Kubernetes environment.
-   Optimized features

    The performance of the CPU overhead is optimized for scenarios where a large number of Logtail configuration files are created to collect container data.

-   Fixed issues

    The issue that the processor\_split\_log\_string plug-in generates blank rows is fixed.


## 0.16.38

    -   A custom name of the time field is supported in full regex mode. Example: time\_key.
    -   The KeepSourceIfParseError parameter is added in the processor\_json, processor\_regex, and processor\_split\_char plug-ins. If raw data fails to be parsed, the raw data can be retained.
