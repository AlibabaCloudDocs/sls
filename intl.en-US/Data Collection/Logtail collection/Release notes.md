# Release notes

This topic describes the release notes of Log Service Logtail.

## 0.16.64

-   Optimized features

    The timeout period for requesting a container engine is increased from 3 seconds to 30 seconds. The DOCKER\_CLIENT\_REQUEST\_TIMEOUT environment variable is added to specify the timeout period for requesting a container engine.

-   Fixed issues
    -   The ID of a parent span in the service\_skywalking plug-in has errors. This issue is fixed.
    -   The code used to create a Logtail configuration file based on environment variables may stop if the related container engine has an exception. This issue is fixed.

## 0.16.62

**Note:** If you are using Logtail V0.16.58 or Logtail V0.16.60, we recommend that you upgrade Logtail to V0.16.62.

-   Fixed issues

    Data may fail to be sent due to out-of-order data. This issue is fixed.


## 0.16.60

-   New features

    Container data in the containerd environment can be collected.


## 0.16.56

-   Optimized features

    The net\_err\_stat metric in service logs applies to sending errors that are caused only by network issues.


## 0.16.54

-   New features

    The net\_err\_stat metric is added in service logs. The number of sending errors that occur in the last 1, 5, or 15 minutes can be recorded.


## 0.16.52

If a large number of Logtail configuration files are created to collect container data \(standard outputs or container files\), we recommend that you upgrade Logtail to V0.16.52 or later. This helps you reduce the CPU overhead.

-   Optimized features

    The CPU overhead during container data collection is optimized.

## 0.16.46

**Note:** If the endpoint of Log Service is in the China \(Hangzhou\), China \(Shanghai\), or China \(Beijing\) region, you can upgrade Logtail to V0.16.46 or later. This prevents Logtail from switching endpoints when network jitter occurs.
