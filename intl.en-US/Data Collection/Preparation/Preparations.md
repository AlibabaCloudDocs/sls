# Preparations

Before you can use Log Service to collect, query, transform, and ship logs, you must perform the required operations.

-   Activate Log Service.
-   Optional. Create an AccessKey pair. For more information, see [Obtain an AccessKey pair]().

    **Note:** You must create an AccessKey pair before you can manage Log Service by using an API or SDKs.

-   Create a project. For more information, see [Create a project](/intl.en-US/Data Collection/Preparation/Manage a project.md).
-   Create a Logstore. For more information, see [Create a Logstore](/intl.en-US/Data Collection/Preparation/Manage a Logstore.md).
-   Optional. Manage shards. For more information, see [Manage shards](/intl.en-US/Data Collection/Preparation/Manage shards.md).
-   Optional. Grant permissions. For more information, see [Control resource access](/intl.en-US/Developer Guide/Access control RAM/Overview.md).
