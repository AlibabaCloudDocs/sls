# Enable the log analysis feature

This topic describes how to enable the log analysis feature in the Cloud Firewall console and collect Internet traffic logs to Log Service.

1.  Log on to the [Cloud Firewall console](https://yundunnext.console.aliyun.com/?p=cfwnext).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Logs** \> **Log Analysis**.

3.  Click **Activate Now**.

4.  Purchase the Cloud Firewall service and complete the payment as prompted.

    In the **Log Analysis** section, click **Yes**. Then, specify a log storage size based on your business requirements. For more information about other parameters, see [t21151.md\#](/intl.en-US/Pricing/Subscription.md).

5.  On the Log Analysis page, select **internet\_log** and turn on the status switch.

    **Note:** If the storage space usage exceeds 70%, you must upgrade the log storage space. Otherwise, you cannot store additional logs.


After Internet traffic logs are collected to Log Service, you can query, analyze, download, ship, and transform the collected logs. You can also configure alerts.
