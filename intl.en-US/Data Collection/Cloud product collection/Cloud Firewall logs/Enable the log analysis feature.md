# Enable the log analysis feature

This topic describes how to enable the log analysis feature in the Cloud Firewall console. After you enable the log analysis feature, you can collect Internet traffic logs to Log Service.

1.  Log on to the [Cloud Firewall console](https://yundunnext.console.aliyun.com/?p=cfwnext).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Logs** \> **Log Analysis**.

3.  Click **Activate Now**.

4.  Purchase the Cloud Firewall service and complete the payment as prompted.

    In the **Log Analysis** section, click **Yes**. Then, specify a log storage size based on your business requirements. For information about other parameters, see [Purchase a Cloud Firewall edition](/intl.en-US/Pricing/Purchase a Cloud Firewall edition.md).

5.  On the Log Analysis page, select **internet\_log** and turn on the status switch.

    **Note:** If the storage space usage exceeds 70%, we recommend that you upgrade the log storage space. Otherwise, you cannot store additional logs and you may lose data.


After Internet traffic logs are collected to Log Service, you can query, analyze, download, ship, and transform the collected logs. You can also configure alerts for the logs.
