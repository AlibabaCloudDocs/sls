# Manage log storage space

This topic describes how to manage the log storage space in the Cloud Firewall console. You can view, upgrade, and clear the log storage space that you purchase.

## Procedure

1.  Log on to the [Cloud Firewall console](https://yundunnext.console.aliyun.com/?p=cfwnext).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Logs** \> **Log Analysis**.

3.  On the Log Analysis page, perform the following operations as needed:

    -   View the log storage space.

        **Note:** You can view the usage of log storage space in the Anti-DDoS Pro or Anti-DDoS Premium console. However, the usage is not updated in real time. The storage space usage displayed is delayed by two hours. If the storage space usage exceeds 70%, you must upgrade the log storage space. Otherwise, you cannot store additional logs.

    -   Upgrade the storage space: Click **Upgrade Storage** and select a log storage capacity.
    -   Clear log data: Click **Clear** to clear log data.

        **Warning:** You cannot restore log data that is cleared. Proceed with caution.
