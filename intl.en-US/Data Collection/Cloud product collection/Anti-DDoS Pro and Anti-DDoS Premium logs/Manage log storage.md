# Manage log storage

This topic describes how to manage the log storage space in the Anti-DDoS Pro or Anti-DDoS Premium console.

## Procedure

1.  Log on to the [Anti-DDoS Pro console](https://yundun.console.aliyun.com/?p=ddoscoo).

2.  In the upper-left corner of the page, select **Mainland China**.

    After you select Mainland China, the Anti-DDoS Pro console appears. If you want to use Anti-DDoS Premium, select **Outside Mainland China**.

3.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Investigation** \> **Log Analysis**.

4.  On the Log Analysis page, manage the log storage space.

    To manage the log storage space, perform the following operations as required:

    -   View the log storage space.

        **Note:** You can view the usage of the log storage space in the Anti-DDoS Pro or Anti-DDoS Premium console. However, the usage is not updated in real time. The storage space usage displayed is delayed by 2 hours. If the storage usage exceeds 70%, you must upgrade the log storage space. Otherwise, you cannot store more logs and data loss may occur.

    -   Extend the validity period of the log analysis feature.

        Click **Renew** and select a duration.

    -   Upgrade the log storage space.

        Click **Upgrade** to upgrade the storage space.

    -   Clear log data.

        Click **Clear** to clear log data.

        **Warning:** You cannot restore log data that is cleared. Proceed with caution.
