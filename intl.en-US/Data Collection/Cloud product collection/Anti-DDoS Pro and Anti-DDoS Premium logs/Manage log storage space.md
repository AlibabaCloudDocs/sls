# Manage log storage space

This topic describes how to manage the log storage space in the Anti-DDoS Pro or Anti-DDoS Premium console.

## Procedure

1.  Log on to the [Anti-DDoS Pro console](https://yundun.console.aliyun.com/?p=ddoscoo).

2.  In the upper-left corner of the page, select **Mainland China**.

    After you select Mainland China, the Anti-DDoS Pro console appears. If you want to use Anti-DDoS Premium, select **Outside Mainland China**.

3.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Investigation** \> **Log Analysis**.

4.  To manage the log storage space that you have purchased on the Log Analysis page, perform the following operations as needed:

    -   View the log storage space.

        **Note:** You can view the usage of log storage space in the Anti-DDoS Pro or Anti-DDoS Premium console. However, the usage is not updated in real time. The storage space usage displayed is delayed by two hours. If the storage space usage exceeds 70%, you must upgrade the log storage space. Otherwise, you cannot store additional logs and you may lose data.

    -   Extend the validity period of the log analysis feature: Click **Renew** and select a duration.
    -   Upgrade the log storage space: Click **Upgrade** and select a log storage capacity.
    -   Clear log data: Click **Clear** to clear log data.

        **Warning:** You cannot restore log data that is cleared. Proceed with caution.
