# Manage the log storage space

This topic describes how to manage the log storage space in the Web Application Firewall \(WAF\) console.

## Procedure

1.  Log on to the [Web Application Firewall console](https://yundun.console.aliyun.com/?p=waf).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Log Management** \> **Log Service**.

3.  On the Log Service page, perform the following operations to manage the log storage space:

    -   View the log storage space.

        **Note:** You can view the usage of log storage space in the WAF console. However, the usage is not updated in real time. The displayed usage does not include the usage in the last two hours. If the usage of log storage space reaches 70%, upgrade the storage capacity to make sure that new logs can be stored.

    -   Upgrade the log storage capacity: Click **Upgrade Storage** and select a larger storage capacity.
    -   Clear the log storage space: Click **Clear** to clear all the log entries in your log storage space.

        After you enable the log analysis feature, you can clear your log storage space for four times in total.

        **Warning:** Log entries that are cleared cannot be restored. Clear log entries with caution.
