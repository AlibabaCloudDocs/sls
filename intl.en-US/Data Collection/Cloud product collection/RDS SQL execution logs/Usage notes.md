# Usage notes

Log Service allows you to import data from other cloud resources. After you enable the SQL audit or SQL explorer feature in the ApsaraDB for RDS console, you can import SQL audit logs to Log Service. Then, you can query, ship, and transform the logs in real time in the Log Service console. You can also visualize log analysis results and configure alerts for the logs. This topic describes the assets, billing, and limits of the RDS SQL audit logs.

## RDS SQL audit logs

The RDS SQL audit logs record all the operations that are performed on the database. RDS collects SQL audit logs based on network listening, which consumes only a few CPU resources of the system. This does not affect the execution of SQL statements. RDS SQL audit logs include but are not limited to the following types of operations data:

-   Database logon and logoff.
-   Data definition language \(DDL\): SQL statements that define the database structure, such as CREATE, ALTER DROP, TRUNCATE, and COMMENT.
-   Data manipulation language \(DML\): SQL statements that perform the operations, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
-   Other operations that are performed by executing SQL statements, such as rollback and control.
-   SQL execution latency, execution results, and number of affected rows.

## Assets

-   Projects and Logstores

    **Note:** We recommend that you do not delete the projects or Logstores that are related to the RDS SQL audit logs. Otherwise, RDS SQL audit logs cannot be sent to Log Service.

-   Dedicated dashboards

    After you import RDS SQL audit logs to Log Service, Log Service generates three dedicated dashboards by default.

    **Note:** We recommend that you do not make changes to the dedicated dashboards because this may affect the usability of the dashboards. You can create a dashboard to visualize log analysis results. For more information, see [Create a dashboard](/intl.en-US/Query and visualization/Dashboard/Create a dashboard.md).

    |Dashboard|Description|
    |---------|-----------|
    |RDS Audit Operation Center|Displays the access statistics of active databases. The statistics include the number of databases, tables, and execution errors. The statistics also include the total number of inserted rows, updated rows, deleted rows, and queried rows.|
    |RDS Audit Performance Center|Displays the performance metrics related to O&M reliability. These metrics include the peak SQL execution, peak query bandwidth, peak insertion bandwidth, peak update bandwidth, peak deletion bandwidth, average SQL execution time, average SQL query time, average SQL update time, and average SQL deletion time.|
    |RDS Audit Security Center|Displays the security metrics of the databases. These metrics include the number of errors, logon failures, major deletion events, major modification events, and risky SQL execution. The metrics also include the distribution of execution error types, distribution of external clients that have errors, and the clients that have the largest number of errors.|


## Billing

-   After you enable SQL audit for ApsaraDB RDS for PostgreSQL instances and ApsaraDB RDS for SQL Server instances or SQL explorer for ApsaraDB RDS for MySQL instances, you are billed for the instances. The billing is based on the hourly usage \(hourly rate = Amount of consumed audit logs Ã— unit price\).

    **Note:** The SQL explorer feature is provided free of charge for the RDS Enterprise Edition.

-   After logs are shipped to Log Service, you are charged for the storage space that the log data occupies and the number of read/write operations. You are also charged for reading, transforming, and shipping the data. For more information, see [Pay-as-you-go](/intl.en-US/Pricing/Pay-as-you-go.md).

## Limits

-   You can import SQL audit logs from only the following types of RDS instances to Log Service:
    -   ApsaraDB RDS for MySQL instances: All available versions except the basic version are supported.
    -   ApsaraDB RDS for PostgreSQL instances and ApsaraDB RDS for SQL Server instances: All available versions are supported.
-   You can import SQL audit logs to Log Service only after you enable the SQL audit feature or the SQL explorer feature for the RDS instances.
-   The Log Service project that stores RDS SQL audit logs must reside in the same region as the RDS instance.
-   You can import SQL audit logs from only the RDS instances that reside in the China \(Qingdao\), China \(Beijing\), China \(Hangzhou\), China \(Shanghai\), China \(Shenzhen\), and China \(Hong Kong\) regions.

    The Log Audit Service application of Log Service can also collect RDS SQL audit logs. In addition, the Log Audit Service application can collect audit logs from more regions. For more information, see [Overview of the Log Audit Service application](/intl.en-US/Application/Log Audit Service/Overview.md).


## Benefits

-   Simple configuration: To import RDS SQL audit logs to Log Service, you only need to perform a few simple operations. This ensures that the RDS SQL audit logs are collected in real time, and the performance of existing databases is not affected.
-   Real-time analysis: Log Service provide real-time analysis and out-of-the-box dashboards. The dashboards provide insights into the performance and security risks of SQL execution.
-   Real-time monitoring: You can use Log Service to monitor specified metrics and send alerts in real time. This allows you to resolve SQL execution exceptions at the earliest opportunity.
-   High compatibility: Log Service is compatible with other big data solutions, such as stream processing, cloud storage, and visualization. This allows you to extract more value from your business data.
