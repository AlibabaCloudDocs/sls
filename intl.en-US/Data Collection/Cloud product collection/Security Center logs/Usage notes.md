# Usage notes

The log analysis feature of Security Center allows you to collect, query, analyze, transform, and consume risk data in real time. You can use the log analysis feature to monitor and handle potential risks and implement centralized management of cloud resources. This topic describes the assets, billing, and limits of the log analysis feature in Security Center.

## Assets

-   Dedicated projects and dedicated Logstores

    After you enable the log analysis feature of Security Center, Log Service creates a project named sas-log-Alibaba Cloud account ID-region name and a Logstore named sas-log.

    **Note:** If you accidentally delete the dedicated Logstore, you are prompted that the sas-log Logstore does not exist. All log data in the Logstore is deleted. In this case, you must [submit a ticket](https://workorder-intl.console.aliyun.com/console.htm?spm=a2796.7919406.0.dcontactus3.676a2d23RjosdV#/ticket/add/?productId=1210) to reset the log analysis feature. You must re-enable the log analysis feature after it is reset. The deleted data cannot be recovered.

-   Dedicated dashboards

    Security Center logs are classified into 3 types and 14 subtypes. After you enable the log analysis feature of Security Center, Log Service generates nine dashboards by default.
