## Scenarios

Sandbox Network is a well-known UGC gaming platform that has released multiple games worldwide and attracted a total of 50 million players. With the increasing number of self-developed and user-generated games, Sandbox Network is expanding its business at a high speed. The business development has posed a big challenge to the business platform of Sandbox Network with higher requirements on intensive O&M. To address this challenge, Sandbox Network needs to integrate upstream data and downstream data and improve the stability of the platform by using a multidimensional monitoring system for better user experience. The company also needs to analyze behavioral data to iteratively optimize its services.

## Challenges

Sandbox Network faces the following challenges:

-   Centralized log collection in global business scenarios where services are deployed on multiple clouds

    Sandbox Network has a global presence. The company has deployed its business clusters inside and outside mainland China, such as India and Hong Kong. In addition, Sandbox Network uses multi-cloud deployment solutions and a cross-border and cross-cloud architecture. Therefore, Sandbox Network requires a centralized method to collect data.

-   Unified management on heterogeneous data that is collected from various sources in different formats

    The business data of Sandbox Network includes the system data of each cloud platform, behavioral data of each game player, and the logs of different clients such as iOS and Android clients. Heterogeneous data that is collected from various sources in different formats poses a big challenge on unified data management.

-   Rapid and elastic scalability that is required by the UGC gaming platform

    Traffic peaks occur when a new game is released, when promotional activities are launched for existing games, or when a hot-selling game comes out. To ensure the business stability of the UGC gaming platform, Sandbox Network requires a service that supports rapid and elastic scaling feature.


## Solution

To help Sandbox Network address the preceding challenges, Alibaba Cloud provides Log Service to help Sandbox Network collect and manage data in a unified manner.

-   Centralized data collection: Log Service provides more than 50 data sources. For example, Logtail can be used to collect logs from Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\), data centers, and the servers of other cloud service providers. In multi-cloud deployment scenarios, Sandbox Network can use Logtail to collect data in a centralized manner and use Log Service as a unified data analysis platform. Log Service also supports multiple transmission methods in different scenarios by combining the internal network and a virtual private cloud \(VPC\), or by using the Internet based on global acceleration.

-   Unified management of heterogeneous data: Log Service is a fully managed and high-availability service that provides the data transformation feature and supports elastic scaling. Log Service is applicable to various scenarios where Sandbox Network needs to standardize, enrich, distribute, reindex, and aggregate data. Log Service helps Sandbox Network transform and standardize heterogeneous data for subsequent data analysis. To prevent the issues that may occur in multi-account and cross-cloud scenarios, Sandbox Network can combine the Log Service console with its business platform to manage data. This simplifies the authorization process. In addition, Log Service provides various dashboards to help different business teams of Sandbox Network visualize data as needed.

-   Elastic scalability: Log Service supports elastic scaling for petabytes of data. Log Service helps Sandbox Network quickly respond to traffic peaks and business growth.
