## User guide {#section_ebd_jjs_zdb .section}

If a Logtail client supporting status query function is installed, you can query local log collection status by entering commands on the client. To install Logtail, see [Install Logtail in Linux](../../../../reseller.en-US/Data Collection/Logtail collection/Install/Install Logtail in Linux.md#).

Enter the `/etc/init.d/ilogtaild -h` command on the client to check if the client supports querying local log collection status. If the `logtail insight, version` keyword is returned, it indicates that this function is supported on the Logtail client.

``` {#codeblock_83m_x40_5ik}
/etc/init.d/ilogtaild -h
Usage: ./ilogtaild { start | stop (graceful, flush data and save checkpoints) | force-stop | status | -h for help}$
logtail insight, version : 0.1.0
commond list :
       status all [index] 
             get logtail running status 
       status active [--logstore | --logfile] index [project] [logstore] 
             list all active logstore | logfile. if use --logfile, please add project and logstore. default --logstore
       status logstore [--format=line | json] index project logstore 
             get logstore status with line or json style. default --format=line 
       status logfile [--format=line | json] index project logstore fileFullPath 
             get log file status with line or json style. default --format=line 
       status history beginIndex endIndex project logstore [fileFullPath] 
             query logstore | logfile history status.  
index : from 1 to 60. in all, it means last $(index) minutes; in active/logstore/logfile/history, it means last $(index)*10 minutes
```

Currently, Logtail supports the following query commands, command functions, time intervals to query and time windows for result statistics:

|Command|Functions|Time interval to query|Time window for statistics|
|:------|:--------|:---------------------|:-------------------------|
|all|Query the running status of Logtail.|Last 60 min|1 min|
|active|Query Logstores or log files that are currently active \(that is, with data collected\).|Last 600 min|10 minutes.|
|logstore|Query the collection status of a Logstore.|Last 600 min|10 minutes.|
|logfile|Query the collection status of a log file.|Last 600 min|10 minutes.|
|history|Query the collection status of a Logstore or log file over a period of time.|Last 600 min|10 minutes.|

**Note:** 

-   The `index` parameter in the command represents the index value of the time window, which is counted from the current time. Its valid range is 1â€“60. If the time window for statistics is one minute, windows in the last `(index, index-1]` minutes are queried. If the time window for statistics is 10 minutes, windows in the last `(10*index, 10*(index-1)]` minutes are queried.
-   All query commands belong to status subcommands, so the main command is status.

## all command {#section_wmp_rjs_zdb .section}

Command format

``` {#codeblock_sxj_ajj_gb4}
/etc/init.d/ilogtaild status all [ index ] 
```

**Note:** The all command is used to view the running status of Logtail. The index parameter is optional. If left blank, 1 is taken by default.

Example

``` {#codeblock_nif_5k3_o95}
/etc/init.d/ilogtaild status all 1
ok
/etc/init.d/ilogtaild status all 10
busy
```

Output description

|Item|Description|Priority|Resolution:|
|:---|:----------|:-------|:----------|
|ok|The current status is normal.|None.|No action is needed.|
|busy|The current collection speed is high and the Logtail status is normal.|None.|No action is needed.|
|many\_log\_files|The number of logs being collected is large.|Low|Check if the configuration contains files that do not need to be collected.|
|process\_block|Current log parsing is blocked.|Low|Check if logs are generated too quickly. If you still get this output, [Set startup parameters](../../../../reseller.en-US/Data Collection/Logtail collection/Install/Set startup parameters.md#) as per your needs to modify the upper limit of CPU usage or the limit on concurrent sending by using network.|
|send\_block|Current sending is blocked.|Relatively high|blocked. Check if logs are generated too quickly and if the network status is normal. If you still get this output, [Set startup parameters](../../../../reseller.en-US/Data Collection/Logtail collection/Install/Set startup parameters.md#) as per your needs to modify the upper limit of CPU usage or the limit on concurrent sending by using network.|
|send\_error|Failed to upload log data.|High|To troubleshoot the issue, see [Diagnose collection errors](reseller.en-US/FAQ/Log collection/Diagnose collection errors.md).|

## active command {#section_yml_cks_zdb .section}

Command format

``` {#codeblock_z5h_vp6_srq}
/etc/init.d/ilogtaild status active [--logstore] index
 /etc/init.d/ilogtaild status active --logfile index project-name logstore-name
				
```

**Note:** 

-   The `active [--logstore] index` command is used to query Logstores that are currently active. The `--logstore` parameter can be omitted without changing the meaning of the command.
-   The `active --logfile index project-name logstore-name` command is used to query all active log files in a Logstore for a project.
-   The active command is used to query active log files level by level. We recommend that you first locate the currently active Logstore and then query active log files in this Logstore.

Example

``` {#codeblock_n78_vr1_q4y}
/etc/init.d/ilogtaild status active 1
sls-zc-test : release-test
sls-zc-test : release-test-ant-rpc-3
sls-zc-test : release-test-same-regex-3

/etc/init.d/ilogtaild status active --logfile 1 sls-zc-test release-test
/disk2/test/normal/access.log
```

Output description

-   To run the `active --logstore index` command, all currently active Logstores are output in the format of `project-name : logstore-name` . To run the `active --logfile index project-name logstore-name` command, the complete paths of active log files are output.
-   A Logstore or log file with no log collection activity in the current query window does not appear in the output.

## logstore command {#section_uxb_kks_zdb .section}

Command format

``` {#codeblock_ese_j0a_hdk}
/etc/init.d/ilogtaild status logstore [--format={line|json}] index project-name logstore-name
				
```

**Note:** 

-   The logstore command is used to output the collection statuses of the specified project and Logstore in LINE or JSON format.
-   If the`--format=` parameter is not configured, `--format=line` is selected by default. The echo information is output in LINE format. Note that `--format` parameter must be placed behind `logstore` .
-   If this Logstore does not exist or has no log collection activity in the current query window, you get an empty output in LINE format or a `null` value in JSON format.

## history command {#section_rzj_cls_zdb .section}

Command format

``` {#codeblock_e3o_ij1_ghw}
/etc/init.d/ilogtaild status history beginIndex endIndex project-name logstore-name [fileFullPath]
				
```

**Note:** 

-   The history command is used to query the collection status of a Logstore or log file over a period of time.
-   `beginIndex` and `endIndex` represent the start and end values for the code query window index respectively. `beginIndex <= endIndex`.
-   If the `fileFullPath` is not entered in the parameter, the code queries the collection information of the Logstore. Otherwise, the collection information of the log file is queried.

Output description

-   This command outputs historical collection information of a Logstore or log file in the form of list, one line for each window.
-   For the description of each output field, see the `logstore` and `logfile` commands.

## Return values {#section_ff4_hls_zdb .section}

Normal return value

0 is returned if a command input is valid \(including failure to query a Logstore or log file\), for example:

``` {#codeblock_cpa_u9o_4jo}
/etc/init.d/ilogtaild status logfile --format=json 1 error-project error-logstore /no/this/file
null
echo $?
0
/etc/init.d/ilogtaild status all
ok
echo $?
0
```

Exceptional return values

A non-zero return value indicates an exception. See the following table.

|Return value|Type|output|Troubleshooting|
|:-----------|:---|:-----|:--------------|
|10|Invalid command or missing parameters|`invalid param, use -h for help.`|Enter `-h` to view help.|
|1|The query goes beyond the 1â€“60 time window|`invalid query interval`|Enter `-h` to view help.|
|1|Cannot query the specified time window|`query fail, error: $(error)`. For more information, see [errno interpretation](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/errno.3.html?spm=a2c4g.11186623.2.24.XN6vN6).|This issue might occur when the startup time of Logtail is less than the query time span. For other cases, open a ticket.|
|1|No matching query window time|`no match time interval, please check logtail Status`|Check if Logtail is running. For other cases, open a ticket.|
|1|No data in the query window|`invalid profile, maybe logtail Restart`|Check if Logtail is running. For other cases, open a ticket.|

Example

``` {#codeblock_ji1_er7_zhw}
/etc/init.d/ilogtaild status nothiscmd
invalid param, use -h for help.
echo $?
10
/etc/init.d/ilogtaild status/all 99
invalid query interval
echo $?
1
```

## Use cases {#section_ysz_pls_zdb .section}

You can obtain the overall status of Logtail by querying its health status, and obtain the related metrics during collection by querying the collection progress. With the obtained information, you can monitor log collection in a customized manner.

## Monitor the running status of Logtail {#section_jcw_rls_zdb .section}

Monitor the running status of Logtail by using the `all` command.

How it works: The current status of Logtail is queried every minute. If Logtail is under `process_block` , `send_block` , or `send_error` status for five successive minutes, an alarm is triggered.

The alarm duration and the status range being monitored can be adjusted according to the importance of log collection in specific scenarios.

## Monitor log collection progress {#section_tsq_sls_zdb .section}

Monitor the collection progress of a Logstore by using the `logstore` command.

How it works: The `logstore` command is called every ten minutes to obtain the status information of this Logstore. If the `avg_delay_bytes` is over 1 MB \(1024\*1024\) or `status` is not `ok` , an alarm is triggered.

The `avg_delay_bytes` alarm threshold can be adjusted according to the log collection traffic.

## Determine whether or not Logtail has finished collecting log files {#section_uxz_tls_zdb .section}

Determine whether or not Logtail has finished collecting log files by using the `logfile`command.

How it works: After writing to the log file stops, the `logfile` command is called every ten minutes to obtain the status information of this file. If this file shows the same value for `read_offset_bytes` and `file_size_bytes` , it means that Logtail has finished collecting this log file.

## Troubleshoot log collection issues {#section_gg1_vls_zdb .section}

If the log collection is delayed on a server, use the `history` command to query related collection information on this server.

1.  If the `send_block_flag` is true, it indicates that the log collection delays because of the network.
    -   If the `send_network_quota_count`is greater than 0, you must split the [Shard](reseller.en-US/Preparation/Manage shards.md) of the Logstore.
    -   If the `send_network_error_count`is greater than 0, you must check the network connectivity.
    -   â—¦If no related network error occurs, you must adjust the limit on concurrent sending and [traffic limit](reseller.en-US/Data Collection/Logtail collection/Install/Set startup parameters.md) of Logtail.
2.  Sending-related parameters are normal, but the `avg_delay_bytes` is relatively high.
    -   The average log parsing speed can be calculated by using `read_bytes` to determine if traffic generated by logs is normal.
    -   [Resource usage limits](reseller.en-US/Data Collection/Logtail collection/Install/Set startup parameters.md) of Logtail can be adjusted as appropriate.
3.  The `parse_fail_lines` is greater than 0.

    Check if the parsing configurations for log collection match with all the logs.
