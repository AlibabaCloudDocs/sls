# Log collection error types {#concept_rlf_bqh_1fb .concept}

On the Logstores page, you can click **Diagnose** of a Logstore to view all log collection errors about it. This topic describes the specific error types and handling methods.

If you encounter an error not mentioned in this topic, you can open a ticket and submit error details.

|Error type|Description|Handling method|
|:---------|:----------|:--------------|
|LOGFILE\_PERMINSSION\_ALARM|Logtail has no permission to read the specified file.|Check the Logtail startup account on the server. We recommend that you start Logtail as the root user.|
|SPLIT\_LOG\_FAIL\_ALARM|The line start regular expression cannot match line starts of the log, and the log cannot be split into lines.|Check the correctness of the line start regular expression. If the log contains only one line, you can set the line start regular expression to `.*`.|
|MULTI\_CONFIG\_MATCH\_ALARM|Each file can only be collected by one Logtail Config.|Check whether a file is collected in multiple Configs. If yes, delete unnecessary Configs.|
|REGEX\_MATCH\_ALARM|The log content does not match the regular expression upon regular expression parsing.|Copy a part from the unmatched content as a sample for a rematch, and then generate a new regular expression.|
|PARSE\_LOG\_FAIL\_ALARM|Log parsing fails because the formats of JSON and delimiter logs do not conform to format definitions.|Click the error message to view details.|
|CATEGORY\_CONFIG\_ALARM|The Logtail Config is invalid.|We recommend that you modify the regular expression because generally the process of extracting a file path as the Topic through the regular expression fails. If the error is due to another reason, open a ticket and submit error details.|
|LOGTAIL\_CRASH\_ALARM|Logtail cannot respond because its server resource usage has exceeded the upper limit.|Modify the upper limits of the CPU usage and memory usage by following the instructions provided in [EN-US\_TP\_13060.md](reseller.en-US/Data Collection/Logtail collection/Install/Set startup parameters.md). You can also open a ticket for additional support.|
|REGISTER\_INOTIFY\_FAIL\_ALARM|Registering log monitoring has failed on Linux. A possible cause is that Logtail does not have the permission to access the folder or the folder has been deleted.|Check whether Logtail has the permission to access the folder and whether the folder has been deleted.|
|DISCARD\_DATA\_ALARM|The CPU resources for configuring Logtail are insufficient or the incoming traffic to Log Service is restricted.|Modify the upper limit of the CPU usage or limits on concurrent incoming traffic to Log Service by following the instructions provided in [EN-US\_TP\_13060.md](reseller.en-US/Data Collection/Logtail collection/Install/Set startup parameters.md). You can also open a ticket for additional support.|
|SEND\_DATA\_FAIL\_ALARM| -   The Alibaba Cloud account have not created any AccessKey \(AK\).
-   The Logtail client cannot connect to the Log Service server, or the connection quality is poor.
-   The writing quota on the server is insufficient.

 | -   Use the Alibaba Cloud account to create an AK.
-   Check the local Config file /usr/local/ilogtail/ilogtail\_config.json and run `curl<endpoint>` to check whether any result is returned.

You can also open a ticket for additional support.|
|DROP\_LOG\_ALARM|Log collection lags behind log generation, and unprocessed log rotations outnumbers 20. In normal cases, this is because the CPU resources for configuring Logtail are insufficient or the incoming traffic to Log Service is restricted.|Modify the upper limit of the CPU usage or limits on concurrent incoming traffic to Log Service by following the instructions provided in [EN-US\_TP\_13060.md](reseller.en-US/Data Collection/Logtail collection/Install/Set startup parameters.md). You can also open a ticket for additional support.|

|ENCODING\_CONVERT\_ALARM|Code conversion fails.|Check whether the log encoding format conforms to the specified format.|
|OUTDATED\_LOG\_ALARM|The log is outdated because the time when Logtail received the log has exceeded more than 12 hour and the log is expired. Possible causes are as follows: -   Log parsing is more than 12 hours behind schedule.
-   Custom time fields are incorrect.
-   The time of the log recording program is incorrect.

 | -   Check whether READ\_LOG\_DELAY\_ALARM exists. If yes, use the method of handling READ\_LOG\_DELAY\_ALARM to handle this error. If no, check the time filed settings.
-   Check the time filed settings. If the time field settings are correct, check whether the time of the log recording program is correct.
