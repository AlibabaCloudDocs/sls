## Procedure {#section_ylg_r1r_12b .section}

Follow these steps to start using the Log Service .NET SDK quickly.

## Step 1 Create an Alibaba Cloud account {#section_zlg_r1r_12b .section}

## Step 2 Obtain an Alibaba Cloud AccessKey {#section_amg_r1r_12b .section}

Before using Log Service .NET SDK, you must apply for an Alibaba Cloud [AccessKey](../../../../reseller.en-US/API Reference/AccessKey.md).

Log on to the Access Key Management page. Select an AccessKey for SDK. If you do not have any, create one and make sure the AccessKey is**enabled** . For how to create an AccessKey, see [Preparation](../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/Preparation/Preparation.md), Create and enable AccessKey in Preparation.

The AccessKey is used in the following steps and must be kept confidential. For more information about [Configurations](reseller.en-US/SDK Reference/Basic DescriptionsÂ /Configurations.md) how to use the AccessKey in SDK, see SDK configuration.

## Step 3 Create a Log Service project and a Logstore {#section_zrq_dbr_12b .section}

Before using Log Service .NET SDK, you must create a Log Service project and a Logstore in the console.

For how to create a project and a Logstore, see [Preparation](../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/Preparation/Preparation.md). Create a project in Manage a project and Create a Logstore in Manage a Logstore.

**Note:** 

-   Make sure that you use the same Alibaba Cloud account to obtain the Alibaba Cloud AccessKey and create the Log Service project and Logstore.
-   For more information about the concepts of Log Service such as project and Logstore, see Core concept [Basic concepts](../../../../reseller.en-US/Product Introduction/Basic concepts/Overview.md#).
-   A project name must be globally unique in Log Service, and a Logstore name must be unique in the same project.
-   After a project is created, you cannot modify the region or migrate the project across regions.

## Step 4 Install the .NET development environment {#section_nrd_3cj_sy .section}

Currently, Log Service SDK supports the .NET 3.5 and .NET 4.0/4.5 running environments. To support the Log Service SDK development, we recommend that you install:

-   Microsoft. Net Framework 3.5/4.0/4.5 \(the specific version depends on the target environment required by your program.\)
-   Visual Studio 2010 and later versions

## Step 5 Download and install Log Service .NET SDK {#section_i2n_jcj_sy .section}

Install the Log Service .NET SDK after you build the .NET development environment. The steps are as follows:

1.  Download
    -   from GitHub: [https://github.com/aliyun/aliyun-log-csharp-sdk](https://github.com/aliyun/aliyun-log-csharp-sdk)
    -   Historical version download: Click [here](http://imgs-storage.cdn.aliyuncs.com/help/sls/aliyun-sls-sdk-dotnet-0.4.1.zip) to download the Log Service .NET SDK package
2.  of the latest version. Log service. Net SDK is a software development kit that does not require additional installation. You can follow the steps below directly in your own visual studio projects.

## Step 6 Start a new Log Service Net project {#section_kfd_mcj_sy .section}

After installing the .NET development environment and the Log Service .NET SDK, you can create a Log Service Net project. For more information, see the LOGSDKSample project of SLSSDK40 solution in [Github](https://github.com/aliyun/aliyun-log-csharp-sdk).
