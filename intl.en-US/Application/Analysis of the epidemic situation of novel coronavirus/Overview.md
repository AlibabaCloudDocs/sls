# Overview

This topic describes the novel coronavirus \(COVID-19\) pandemic analysis application and its features.

## Background information

The COVID-19 pandemic analysis application is designed based on the visualized data search and analytics feature of Alibaba Cloud Log Service. You can use the COVID-19 pandemic analysis application to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on various countries, regions, provinces, and states. The COVID-19 pandemic analysis application is available to governments, communities, third-party platforms, and developers. For more information, see [Application operation and management](/intl.en-US/Application/Analysis of the epidemic situation of novel coronavirus/Application operation and management.md).

## What is Log Service?

Log Service is a one-stop service to process log data. The service allows you to collect, consume, ship, search, and analyze large amounts of log data without the need for extra code resources. This helps you improve O&M and operational efficiency. Log Service provides features such as real-time data collection, consumption, shipping, search, and analysis. Log Service facilitates real-time monitoring, and is applicable to development, O&M, operations, and security control of data warehouses and other systems.

## Features

-   Synchronizes data about the COVID-19 pandemic in countries, regions, provinces, and states across the globe on a regular basis, and visualizes the analysis results.

    **Note:** Log Service allows you to collect data from various data sources, as shown in the preceding figure. The COVID-19 pandemic data in Log Service comes from the data repository of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Visual Dashboard operated by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering \(JHU CSSE\).

-   Provides multiple built-in dashboards and allows you to customize dashboards.

    Log Service provides built-in dashboards that display the COVID-19 pandemic data of countries, regions, provinces, and states across the globe. By using Log Service, you can search and analyze the pandemic data, use charts to visualize query results, and organize the charts in dashboards. You can also configure drill-down or drill-up events and alerts.
