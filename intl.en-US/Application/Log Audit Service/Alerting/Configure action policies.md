# Configure action policies

The Log Audit Service application provides the built-in action policy and sends related alert notifications. To customize an action policy, you can add an action policy or edit the built-in action policy. This topic describes how to edit the built-in action policy.

By default, the built-in action policy \(log sls.app.audit.builtin\) sends alert notifications to the built-in user group \(sls.app.audit.builtin\) by using emails. If the severity level of an alert is high or critical, Log Service also sends alert notifications to the built-in user group \(sls.app.audit.builtin\) by using SMS messages. If the severity level of an alert is critical, Log Service also sends alert notifications to the built-in user group \(sls.app.audit.builtin\) by using voice messages.

## Procedure

1.  Log on to the [Log Service console](https://sls.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the Log Application section, click **Log Audit Service**.

3.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Audit Alert** \> **Policy Settings** \> **Action Policy**.

4.  Find the built-in action policy and click **Edit**.

5.  Add an action policy.

    Log Service allows you to configure action policies in basic edit mode or advanced edit mode. If the basic edit mode does not meet your business requirements, you can enable the advanced edit mode to configure finer-grained alert policies.

            The preceding figure shows that alert notifications generated by the Alibaba Cloud account 132\*\*\*\*8765 are sent to the built-in user group by using emails. The notification content is specified in the built-in alert template. The following table describes the parameters.
