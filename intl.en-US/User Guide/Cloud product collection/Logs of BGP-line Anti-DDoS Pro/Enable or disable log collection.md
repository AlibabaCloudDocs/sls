# Enable or disable log collection {#task_jgv_r3h_1gb .task}

When you purchase the Anti-DDoS Pro service, the log collection function is automatically enabled. You can disable or re-enable the log collection function of the specified website.

Log Service can collect website access logs and HTTP flood attack logs of Alibaba Cloud Anti-DDoS Pro in real time. Log Service also supports real-time retrieval and analysis of the collected log data and displays the query results in the form of dashboards. By analyzing the access and attack activities in real time through logs, Log Service helps the security department set protection policies.

1.  Log on to the Anti-DDoS Pro console, and choose **Statistics** \> **Full Log** in the left-side navigation pane.
2.  Select the website for which you want to enable log collection, turn on or off the **Status** switch. By default, log collection is enabled when you purchase Anti-DDoS Pro. This function is also enabled for newly added websites.
