# Manage log storage space {#concept_l31_543_1gb .concept}

After you enable the Anti-DDoS Pro log collection function, log data is pushed to the specified Logstore in real time. You can view the usage of the log storage space in the Anti-DDoS Pro console.

## View log storage usage {#section_obl_hnz_qfb .section}

You can view the usage of the log storage for Anti-DDoS Pro Log Service at any time.

**Note:** The log storage information in the console is not updated in real time. It takes up to two hours to synchronize the actual storage information to the console. Therefore, we recommend that you expand the log storage space before it is exhausted.

1.  Log on to the Anti-DDoS Pro console.
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Statistics** \> **Full Log**.
3.  In the upper-right corner of the page, view the log storage usage.
