# Use Go consumer groups to consume LogHub logs {#concept_270142 .concept}

Aliyun LOG Go Consumer Library is a consumer library compiled in Go. It enables multiple consumers to consume data in a Logstore at the same time. Go Consumer Library provides a high-performance mode for you to consume logs in Log Service. It allows you to control resources to be consumed and automatically reconnect to Log Service after disconnection. Using Go Consumer Library, you can focus on the business logic and do not need to worry about the shard distribution, checkpoint, or failover.
