# Graph description {#concept_q3w_zmq_zdb .concept}

Log Service provides a function similar to the SQL aggregate computing. All the SQL aggregate computing results can be rendered by using the visualized graphs provided by Log Service.

**Note:** Before using the visualized graphs, read [Syntax description](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Index and query/Syntax description.md).

## Prerequisites {#section_wwg_tmv_tdb .section}

1.  Create an index and **enable** the analytics.
2.  Log Service shows the graphs to you according to the statistical results only when you use the analysis statement for query.

## Graph type {#section_pn5_ymv_tdb .section}

Currently, Log Service provides the following types of graphs.
