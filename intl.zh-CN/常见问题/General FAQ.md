## Q: Why is LOG better than other solutions? {#section_d56_x0p_55d .section}

Most of LOG customers had experience with ELK \(Elastic Search, Logstash, Kibana\) or other log service solutions. LOG is proven with better performance and more cost-effective. Here are the feedbacks from real customer cases:

-   Performance – LOG has far better performance under an enterprise environment. ELK customers have to face a number of challenges when their business grows big: queries hung during peak hours, heartbeat failure, out of memory errors and other problems under heavy stress.
-   TCO – With ELK, you have to purchase resources including server, storage, and network. But this is just 30%-40% of the total cost. You have to invest more on setup, maintenance, support, etc. LOG is simply a cloud-based SaaS solution. You just need enable it and start to use. You will be billed only for your actual usage.
-   Time to Value – ELK requires weeks/months planning and setup. With LOG, it costs you minutes to get started. LOG also provides instructions to migrate from an existing ELK environment. It would be just few commands.
